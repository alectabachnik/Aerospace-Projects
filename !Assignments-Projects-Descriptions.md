AER403 Report - Walking Linkage Synthesis Assignment. Given a motor, groups were expected to come up with 3 different linkages which would allow the robot to walk. These 3 linkage systems must be animated on matlab, with velocity and displacement analysis being performed as well. Out of the 3 designs, the best one should be chosen and synthesized in the manufacturing lab. On the last day of class, a competition was held to see which robot can cross 3m quickest. Our groups robot tied for 4th place out of well over 30. An image of an alternative design made in motiongen.io is saved in this folder as 'AlternativeLinkage'. A video of another design in motiongen.io is named as 'LinkageSimulation.mov'. Finally, after completing manufacturing, the main design was decently quick, and a video of the physical robot walking can be seen in the file 'WalkingRobotFinal'.

AER404 Spar Assignment - Given a NACA airfoil (which will be used for maximum dimension restrictions), a program was made in matlab which sorts through all possible spar orientations for a filled rod, hollow rod, and rectangular rod. A maximum deflection was given, which when paired to the yield strength of the 2 materials (aluminium or carbon fibre), would filter through all of the physically possible options. The main goal is to find the single cheapest orientation which is strong enough to prevent over 5% deflection. 

CPS125 Assignment 1 - A program was written in C, which sorts through a file with 6 great lake trends in 2023, provided by NOAA. The data was structured into 3D arrays for simplicity, and functions were used to calculate daily and yearly trends.

Final Sim + Runaircraftmodel + Project Final Report - This project tasked groups to code a fully functional flight simulator from scratch using simulink and matlab. The input for this flight simulator was given as a specific joystick (access to joystick was given in labs). The 'Runaircraftmodel' file is the given values used to double check the accuracy of the equations used and graphs. The 'Final Sim' file is the matlab and simulink files integrated together, with a joystick as an input for the flight simulator. The report features more information on the actual simulator, as well as an in depth dive into how it works.

Gearbox Redesign Report B - For this project groups were given a gearbox which had several issues with them, groups were required to add an additional gear, and come up with other creative solutions to fix the problems with the gearbox, or improve it in other ways. The report features all of the steps an engineer / designer should take when coming up with a new design. Unfortunately this year the gearbox was not manufactured, however the cad file for the
